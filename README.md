- pyHTM	
. pyHTM - Hierarchical Temporal Memory in Python; 
. Our machine intelligence technology is called Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM), which is a detailed computational theory of the neocortex. At the core of HTM are time-based learning algorithms that store and recall spatial and temporal patterns. HTM is well suited to a wide variety of problems, particularly those with the following characteristics:
.   Streaming data rather than static databases
.    Underlying patterns in the data change over time
.    Many individual data sources where hand crafting separate models is impractical
.    Subtle patterns that canâ€™t always be seen by humans
.    Time-based patterns
.    Simple techniques such as thresholds yield substantial false positives and false negatives

- GHMM	
. The General Hidden Markov Model library (GHMM) is a freely available C library implementing efficient data structures and algorithms for basic and extended HMMs with discrete and continous emissions. It comes with Python wrappers which provide a much nicer interface and added functionality.	[link](http://ghmm.org/)
. pyHSMM	"This is a Python library for approximate unsupervised inference in Bayesian Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and explicit-duration Hidden semi-Markov Models (HSMMs), focusing on the Bayesian Nonparametric extensions, the HDP-HMM and HDP-HSMM, mostly with weak-limit approximations. There are also some extensions:
. autoregressive models
. switching linear dynamical systems
. factorial models

# Other Cool stuff
- Node Box
. NodeBox makes it easy to do data visualisations, generative design and complex production challenges. [link](https://www.nodebox.net/node/)
- Feature Forge
. This library provides a set of tools that can be useful in many machine learning applications (classification, clustering, regression, etc.), and particularly helpful if you use scikit-learn (although this can work if you have a different algorithm).
