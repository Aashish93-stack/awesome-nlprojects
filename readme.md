- pyHTM
. pyHTM - Hierarchical Temporal Memory in Python;
. Our machine intelligence technology is called Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM), which is a detailed computational theory of the neocortex. At the core of HTM are time-based learning algorithms that store and recall spatial and temporal patterns. HTM is well suited to a wide variety of problems, particularly those with the following characteristics:
.   Streaming data rather than static databases
.    Underlying patterns in the data change over time
.    Many individual data sources where hand crafting separate models is impractical
.    Subtle patterns that canâ€™t always be seen by humans
.    Time-based patterns
.    Simple techniques such as thresholds yield substantial false positives and false negatives

- KnowRob
. KnowRob is a knowledge processing system that combines knowledge representation and reasoning methods with techniques for acquiring knowledge and for grounding the knowledge in a physical system and can serve as a common semantic framework for integrating information from different sources. KnowRob combines static encyclopedic knowledge, common-sense knowledge, task descriptions, environment models, object information and information about observed actions that has been acquired from various sources (manually axiomatized, derived from observations, or imported from the web). It supports different deterministic and probabilistic reasoning mechanisms, clustering, classification and segmentation methods, and includes query interfaces as well as visualization tools.
